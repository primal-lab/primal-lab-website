Asmin Pothula is pursuing a thesis-based Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington, where she also earned her Honors Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in December 2024. Her current research explores deep reinforcement learning to train an agent that mimics human painting actions by recreating target images through sequential brush strokes. She is broadly interested in the intersection of machine learning, vision, and design.
