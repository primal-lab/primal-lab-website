Apar is a graduate student in the CSE department at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). Prior to joining UTA, he worked as a Software Engineer in SAE International, where he worked on improving auditing and accreditation systems across aerospace, manufacturing and medical devices. 

Apar holds a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from UT Arlington. His research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and 3D vision, with a focus on Diffusion Models, Point Clouds, Neural Rendering, and novel view synthesis. He is especially passionate about leveraging NeRFs and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable photorealistic and geometrically accurate scene reconstruction.
