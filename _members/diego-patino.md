Professor Patiño is an assistant professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department 
at the University of Texas - Arlington (UTA). Before his current appointment at UTA, he
worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer 
Engineering at Drexel University, working with Professor David K. Han. Before joining
Drexel, he was a Post-Doctoral Researcher in the GRASP Laboratory at the University of 
Pennsylvania, working under the supervision of Professor Kostas Daniilidis. 

Dr. Patiño received my B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Engineering from the 
National University of Colombia, in 2010, 2012, and 2020 respectively. His 
research interests revolve around machine learning and geometric approaches to 
computer vision with applications in robotics. My research focuses on 3D vision, 
symmetry detection, 3D Reconstruction, graph neural networks, robot perception, and 
reinforcement learning.
